### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Sam:)
#### I am an ML Enthusiast


Apart from laughing at dumb jokes, you'll find my unhealthy obsession with AI peculiar. Trying to make a mark in this huge cosmos by just being myself. You'll also find me engaging in deep philosophical conversations.
I have a deep appreciation for music and spend most of my time on my piano or guitar :)

I love neural networks... 

Always open to music suggestions and stupid jokes ;)

Skills: ML / DL / HTML / CSS / Python
